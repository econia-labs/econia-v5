# Overview

The Python scripts in this folder are intended to be run in a Python-based
`pre-commit` harness that facilitates running custom Python scripts in
`pre-commit`, both for developers locally and in CI with github actions.

If you haven't yet, make sure to [install the required tools first].

If you want to quickly format your Python files so that they pass the
`pre-commit` checks, you can [run our formatting script].

## Running the python formatters

Since our `pre-commit` hooks generally avoid making changes in place during
the `pre-commit` hook suite, you may need to make changes to your Python files
to pass the checks.

Some of these changes may require you to make manual changes, but if they
are issues with formatting and linting, you can easily fix a large portion
of them by running our formatting script:

```shell
# Running from Econia repo root.
./src/sh/python-lint/format.sh
```

While you can directly run the associated Python formatter script using the
Python interpreter, for ease of use we've provided a shell script wrapper at
[/src/sh/python-lint/format.sh](../../sh/python-lint/format.sh), which
can verify your Poetry dependencies and can be run from anywhere, regardless of
your current working directory.
